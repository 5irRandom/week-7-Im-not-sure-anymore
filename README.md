# week-7-Im-not-sure-anymore
Homework for week 7, at least I think we're at week 7.


This is a very WIP build of the weather program primarily uploaded to get it on time.
I intend to continue working on this in the morning, but as it stands it currently allows you to search a city and get back the current temperature in farenheit.
There is a lot of extra info still in the console as I haven't cleared out the console.logs just yet.
Next step is going to be showing more data, such as humidity, UV index, and the 5 day forecast, as well as clearing it on a new search.
After that will come storing it in localstorage followed by calling it up when clicked on.
Then if I get around to it, making it look good.
